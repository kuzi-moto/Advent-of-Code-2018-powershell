# Notes

## Part 1

This part was also pretty straightforward. Just converted uppercase characters to their ASCII values, and the lowercase to the opposite of their uppercase counterparts. Then run through the polymer and remove pairs that equal zero.

## Part 2

This part was also pretty easy to solve just added an extra loop to cycle through all letter combinations. Takes half a minute to run, while isn't terrible there is quite a bit of room for improvement.
