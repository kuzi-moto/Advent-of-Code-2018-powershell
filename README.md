# Advent-of-Code-2018-powershell

My take on the Advent of Code challenge of 2018. I generally wouldn't consider myself a "programmer" but have used a lot of powershell and thought it would be fun to try and participate and see how far I can push the limits of my knowledge.

## Rules & Organization

* Each day gets its own folder. Each folder will contain:
  * Part 1 & 2 solutions.
  * A readme for anything noteworthy.
  * The input file for the day.
  * Runtime stats for part 2.
* Try to do everything on my own, no peeking at other solutions. Googling for general powershell usage allowed.
* Code will be in a basic function block so I can use Measure-Command -Expression {SolutionCommand} to get the execution times easily
* All of the scripts can be run without any arguments to grab the default input, or supply a path to the desired file.
* Test my knowledge of Powershell and hopfully learn something new.
* Okay to skip a day if it's not fun or taking too long.

## Status

| Day | Part 1      | Part 2   |

| 2   | Complete    | Complete |
| 3   | Complete    | Complete |
| 4   | Complete    | In-Progress |
