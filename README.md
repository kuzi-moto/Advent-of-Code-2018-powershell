# Advent-of-Code-PowerShell

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is series of programming challenges where a new problem is revealed every day for the month of December, until Christmas. I'll be attempting these challenges using PowerShell to improve my skill with it. Though you are able to use any language you want.

## Rules & Organization

* Each day gets its own folder. Each folder will contain:
  * Part 1 & 2 solutions.
  * A readme for anything noteworthy.
  * The input file for the day.
  * Runtime stats for part 2.
* Try to do everything on my own, no peeking at other solutions. Googling for general powershell usage allowed.
* Code will be in a basic function block so I can use Measure-Command -Expression {SolutionCommand} to get the execution times easily
* All of the scripts can be run without any arguments to grab the default input, or supply a path to the desired file.
* Test my knowledge of Powershell and hopefully learn something new.
* Okay to skip a day if it's not fun or taking too long.
